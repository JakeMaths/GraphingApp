Changelog:

Version 0.0.2 
9/26/2023

	Graph zoom functionality moved into separate functions:
		+ Graph::zoomIn()
		+ Graph::zoomOut()
	Zoom amount scales linearly with graph (x,y) range.

	Removed drawing functions as collection of vertecies:
		- Graph::functionVertices()

	Changed axis tick mark generation to allow float values.

	Changed graph movement speed to scale with viewing range.

	Added debug info display for testing. Can be disabled on last line in Graph::Graph() constructor.

	However, there is a bug currently: 
	The viewing range can be adjusted for unexpected behavior.
	After some zooms and moves, an axis may become frozen, and only one will react to zooms/moves.
	After some zooms and moves, the program may stop responding and crash.
	This appears to be occuring due to the 7 decimal point precision of floats. 
	I will see what I can do about this bug later.

	Connected lines for graphing instead of individual vertices.

	Windows build support and build procedures.

	Documentation via Doxygen. See docs/doxygen/html/index.html.
