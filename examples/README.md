# Examples

### Examples created and ran using C++ package SFML.
### On Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt install libsfml-dev`.
### Then run `make` in an example directory to compile the program.

### I have not tested on other distributions.
### There should be a way to make this work on Windows, but Linux was very easy.
